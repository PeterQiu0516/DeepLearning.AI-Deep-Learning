# Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects

Notes and exercises for the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI

## Course Syllabus

+ ### Week 1 - ML Strategy (1): Evaluation Metric, Train/Dev/Test Distributions, Human-level Performance and Avoidable Bias
  + Machine Learning flight simulator: Bird recognition in the city of Peacetopia (case study)
  
    To help you practice strategies for machine learning, the following exercise will present an in-depth scenario and ask how you would act. Consider airplane pilots who’s training involves time spent in flight simulators. These flight simulators accelerate the pilots’ learning by allowing them to experience a volume and variety of scenarios that they otherwise may have needed a much longer time to acquire.

    The following exercise is a “flight simulator” for machine learning. Rather than you needing to spend years working on a machine learning project before you get to experience certain scenarios, you’ll get to experience them right here.
    
    Personal note from Andrew: *I’ve found practicing with scenarios like these to be useful for training PhD students and advanced Deep Learning researchers. This is the first time this type of “airplane simulator” for machine learning strategy has ever been made broadly available. I hope this helps you gain “real experience” with machine learning much faster than even full-time machine learning researchers typically do from work experience.*



+ ### Week 2 - ML Strategy (2): Error Analysis, Data Mismatch, Transfer Learning & Multi-task Learning, End-to-end Deep Learning
  + Autonomous driving (case study)

## About

Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects

You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI, and know how to set direction for your team's work, this course will show you how.

Much of this content has never been taught elsewhere, and is drawn from my experience building and shipping many deep learning products. This course also has two "flight simulators" that let you practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. This provides "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.

After 2 weeks, you will: 
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
- Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

I've seen teams waste months or years through not understanding the principles taught in this course. I hope this two week course will save you months of time.

This is a standalone course, and you can take this so long as you have basic machine learning knowledge. This is the third course in the Deep Learning Specialization.
